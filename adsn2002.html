<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

<p>
First International Workshop on Assurance in Distributed Systems
and Networks (ADSN 2002)
(see for detail <a href="http://adsn.nets.ce.hiroshima-cu.ac.jp">http://adsn.nets.ce.hiroshima-cu.ac.jp</a>).
</p>

<p class="center">
Vienna, Austria
July 2, 2002
</p>

<p>
Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Distributed
Processing.
In cooperation with IEICE Technical Committee on Information
Networks and IEICE Technical Committee on Fault Tolerant Systems.
</p>

<p>
This workshop will be held in conjunction with the 22nd International
Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2002)
(see for detail <a href="http://icdcs2002.di.fc.ul.pt">http://icdcs2002.di.fc.ul.pt</a>).
</p>

<p>
The objective of this Workshop is to provide an effective forum for original
scientific and engineering advances in Assurance in Distributed Systems
and Networks. Along with recent rapid growth of the Internet, autonomous
decentralized systems are connected with each other.  In these systems,
heterogeneous requirements are independently generated and the
requirements themselves are frequently changing.  Assurance in these
systems is defined as capability of adaptability to heterogeneous and
changing requirements.
The workshop is of interest in the sense that requirements for assurance
in distributed systems and networks are increasing in the future Internet
and technologies on assurance including integration of various technologies
on real time, fault tolerance, autonomy, mobility and intelligence have
high possibilities to cope with complex distributed systems and networks.
</p>

<p>
Topics of interest for this workshop include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>- Heterogeneous coexistence techniques.
  <li>- Techniques for achieving high dependability in complex systems.
  <li>- System life-cycle, specification, design, implementation,
  verification, and validation techniques of assurance.
  <li>- System management techniques for assurance.
  <li>- Real-time technology for assurance systems.
  <li>- Software and hardware technologies (E-commerce, Intelligent
  transport system, Train control, Space computer) for assurance.
  <li>- Agents technologies for assurance.
  <li>- Security issues for information warfare.
  <li>- Network control (QoS, CoS, etc) technologies for assurance.
</ul>
