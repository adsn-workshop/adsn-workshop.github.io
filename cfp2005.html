<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

<h2>4th International Workshop on Assurance in Distributed Systems and
Networks (ADSN 2005)</h2>

<p>Columbus, Ohio, USA<br>
June 6, 2005</p>

<p>Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Distributed
Processing.
In cooperation with IEICE Technical Committee on Information
Networks and IEICE Technical Committee on Dependable Computing.</p>

<p>This workshop will be held in conjunction with the 25th International
Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2005)(see for detail
<a
href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/icdcs05/">http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/icdcs05/</a>).</p>

<p>The objective of this Workshop is to provide an effective forum for
original scientific and engineering advances in Assurance in Distributed
Systems and Networks. Along with recent rapid growth of the Internet and
ubiquitous networks, autonomous decentralized systems are connected with
each other.  In these systems and networks, heterogeneous requirements
are independently generated and the requirements themselves are
frequently changing.  Assurance in these systems and networks is defined
as capability of adaptability to heterogeneous and changing requirements.
The workshop is of interest in the sense that requirements for assurance
in distributed systems and networks are increasing in the future Internet
and ubiquitous networks and technologies on assurance including
integration of various technologies on real time, fault tolerance,
autonomy, mobility and intelligence have high possibilities to cope with
complex distributed systems and networks.</p>


<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include, but are not limited to:<br>

<ul>
  <li>Heterogeneous coexistence techniques.</li>
  <li>Techniques for achieving high dependability in complex systems.</li>
  <li>System life-cycle, specification, design, implementation,
verification, and validation techniques of assurance.</li>
  <li>System management techniques for assurance.</li>
  <li>Real-time technology for assurance systems.</li>
  <li>Software and hardware technologies (E-commerce, Intelligent
transport system, Train control, Space computer) for assurance.</li>
  <li>Self-stabilization and sensor networks.</li>
  <li>Agents technologies for assurance.</li>
  <li>Security issues for information warfare.</li>
  <li>Network control (QoS, CoS, etc) technologies for assurance.</li>
  <li>Web service-based computing systems.</li>
</ul>
