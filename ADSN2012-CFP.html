<h2 align=center>The Eleventh International Workshop on Assurance in Distributed Systems and Networks (ADSN2012)</h2>

<p align=center>Macau, China, June 18-21, 2012</p>

<p align=center>Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Distributed Processing <br>
in cooperation with IEICE Technical Committee on Information Networks and IEICE Technical Committee on 
Dependable Computing</p>

<p align=center>This workshop will be held in conjunction with the 32nd International Conference on 
Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2012).<br>
(<a href="http://icdcs-2012.org/">http://icdcs-2012.org/</a>).</p>

<p>The objective of the Workshop is to provide an effective forum for original 
scientific and engineering advances in Assurance in Distributed Systems and 
Networks. Along with recent rapid growth of the Internet and ubiquitous networks, 
autonomous decentralized systems are connected with each other. In these 
distributed systems and networks, heterogeneous requirements are independently 
generated and the requirements themselves are frequently changing. Assurance in 
these distributed systems and networks is defined as capability of guaranteeing 
functional and nonfunctional system properties such as dependability, security, 
timeliness and adaptivity to heterogeneous and changing requirements. The workshop 
theme is critical in meeting ever more demanding requirements for assurance in 
systems and networks, especially in the future Internet and ubiquitous networks. 
Technologies supporting assurance including integration of various technologies 
such as real time, fault tolerance, autonomy, mobility and intelligence will have 
to be incorporated in complex distributed systems and networks.</p>


<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include, but are not limited to:<br>

<ul>
  <li>Assurance technologies for new generation network</li>
  <li>Agents technologies for assurance</li>
  <li>Assurance in cooperative embedded, grid and cloud computing systems</li>
  <li>Heterogeneous systems coexistence and consistency technologies</li>
  <li>Network control (QoS, QoE, CoS, etc) technologies for assurance</li>
  <li>Real-time technology assurance</li>
  <li>Self-stabilization and sensor networks assurance</li>
  <li>Service-oriented and web service-based computing systems</li>
  <li>Software and hardware technologies (E-commerce, intelligent transport systems, train control, space computers) for assurance</li>
  <li>System life-cycle, specification, design, implementation, testing, verification, validation, and security technologies for assurance</li>
  <li>System management and proactive fault management technologies for assurance</li>
  <li>Technologies for achieving high assurance in complex systems</li>
</ul>
