<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

<h2>The Fifth International Workshop on Assurance in Distributed Systems and Networks (ADSN2006)</h2>

<p>Lisboa, Portugal<br>
July 2006</p>

<p>Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee
on Distributed Processing
in cooperation with IEICE Technical Committee on Information Networks
and IEICE Technical Committee on Dependable Computing</p>

<p>This workshop will be held in conjunction with the 26th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2006)(see for detail <a href="http://icdcs2006.di.fc.ul.pt/index.html">http://icdcs2006.di.fc.ul.pt/index.html</a>).</p>

<p>The objective of the Workshop is to provide an effective forum for original scientific and engineering advances in Assurance in Distributed Systems and Networks. Along with recent rapid growth of the Internet and ubiquitous networks, autonomous decentralized systems are connected
with each other.  In these distributed systems and networks, heterogeneous requirements are independently generated and the requirements 
themselves are frequently changing.  Assurance in these distributed systems and
networks is defined as capability of guaranteeing functional and nonfunctional system properties such as dependability, security, 
timeliness and adaptivity to heterogeneous and changing requirements.  The workshop theme is critical in meeting 
ever more demanding requirements for assurance in systems and networks, especially in the future Internet and ubiquitous networks. Technologies supporting
assurance including integration of various technologies such as real time,
fault tolerance, autonomy, mobility and intelligence will have to be
incorporated in complex distributed systems and networks.</p>


<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include, but are not limited to:<br>

<ul>
  <li>Heterogeneous coexistence techniques.</li>
  <li>Techniques for achieving high dependability in complex systems.</li>
  <li>System life-cycle, specification, design, implementation,
verification, and validation techniques of assurance.</li>
  <li>System management techniques for assurance.</li>
  <li>Real-time technology for assurance systems.</li>
  <li>Software and hardware technologies (E-commerce, Intelligent
transport system, Train control, Space computer) for assurance.</li>
  <li>Self-stabilization and sensor networks.</li>
  <li>Agents technologies for assurance.</li>
  <li>Security issues for information warfare.</li>
  <li>Network control (QoS, CoS, etc) technologies for assurance.</li>
  <li>Web service-based computing systems.</li>
</ul>
