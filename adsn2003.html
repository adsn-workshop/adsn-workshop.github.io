<h2>Call for Papers</h2>

<p>Second International Workshop on Assurance in Distributed Systems and
Networks (ADSN 2003)</p>

<p>Providence, Rhode Island, USA<br>
May 19, 2003</p>

<p>Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on
Distributed Processing.  In cooperation with IEICE Technical Committee
on Information Networks and IEICE Technical Committee on Dependable
Computing (Approval Pending).</p>

<p>This workshop will be held in conjunction with the 23rd International
Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2003)(see for
detail <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/icdcs/">http://www.cse.msu.edu/icdcs/</a>).</p>

<p>The objective of this Workshop is to provide an effective forum for
original scientific and engineering advances in Assurance in
Distributed Systems and Networks. Along with recent rapid growth of
the Internet, autonomous decentralized systems are connected with each
other. In these systems, heterogeneous requirements are independently
generated and the requirements themselves are frequently
changing. Assurance in these systems is defined as capability of
adaptability to heterogeneous and changing requirements. The workshop
is of interest in the sense that requirements for assurance in
distributed systems and networks are increasing in the future Internet
and technologies on assurance including integration of various
technologies on real time, fault tolerance, autonomy, mobility and
intelligence have high possibilities to cope with complex distributed
systems and networks.</p>

<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include, but are not limited to:<br>

<ul>
  <li>Heterogeneous coexistence techniques.</li>
  <li>Techniques for achieving high dependability in complex systems.</li>
  <li>System life-cycle, specification, design, implementation,
verification, and validation techniques of assurance.</li>
  <li>System management techniques for assurance.</li>
  <li>Real-time technology for assurance systems.</li>
  <li>Software and hardware technologies (E-commerce, Intelligent
transport system, Train control, Space computer) for assurance.</li>
  <li>Self-stabilization and sensor networks.</li>       
  <li>Agents technologies for assurance.</li>
  <li>Security issues for information warfare.</li>
  <li>Network control (QoS, CoS, etc) technologies for assurance.</li>
</ul>
