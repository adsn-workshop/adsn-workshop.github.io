<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

<h2>Third International Workshop on Assurance in Distributed Systems and
Networks (ADSN 2004)</h2>

<p>Tokyo, Japan<br>
March 23, 2004</p>

<b><font color="red">
Note! The submission deadline is extended to September 15.
</font></b>

<p>Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Distributed
Processing. In cooperation with IEICE Technical Committee on Information
Networks and IEICE Technical Committee on Dependable Computing.</p>

<p>This workshop will be held in conjunction with the 24th International
Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2004)(see for detail
<a
href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/icdcs04/">http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/icdcs04/</a>).</p>

<p>The objective of this Workshop is to provide an effective forum for
original scientific and engineering advances in Assurance in Distributed
Systems and Networks. Along with recent rapid growth of the Internet,
autonomous decentralized systems are connected with each other. In these
systems, heterogeneous requirements are independently generated and the
requirements themselves change frequently. Assurance in these systems is
defined as capability of adaptability to heterogeneous and changing
requirements. The workshop is of interest in the sense that requirements
for assurance in distributed systems and networks are increasing in the
future Internet and technologies on assurance including integration of
various technologies on real time, fault tolerance, autonomy, mobility
and intelligence have high possibilities to cope with complex distributed
systems and networks.
</p>

<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include, but are not limited to:<br>

<ul>
  <li>Heterogeneous coexistence techniques.</li>
  <li>Techniques for achieving high dependability in complex systems.</li>
  <li>System life-cycle, specification, design, implementation,
verification, and validation techniques of assurance.</li>
  <li>System management techniques for assurance.</li>
  <li>Real-time technology for assurance systems.</li>
  <li>Software and hardware technologies (E-commerce, Intelligent
transport system, Train control, Space computer) for assurance.</li>
  <li>Self-stabilization and sensor networks.</li>
  <li>Agents technologies for assurance.</li>
  <li>Security issues for information warfare.</li>
  <li>Network control (QoS, CoS, etc) technologies for assurance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Papers and Submissions</h2>

<p>Papers must be written in English, and they have to be in Postscript,
PDF, or Word format. The complete manuscript should be no more than 12
pages of double-spaced text with 11pt fonts. The following information
must be provided on a cover sheet:</p>

<pre>
  (1) paper title, full name, affiliation of the author(s),
  (2) full name, affiliation, complete address, phone and fax numbers, and
email address of the author to be contacted, as well as
  (3) an abstract (up to a 150 words).
</pre>

<p>To submit a research paper, please send an electronic version of the
manuscript to the program chair Hidenori Nakazato by e-mail.</p>

<p>Authors are expected to present their paper at the Workshop. At least one
author of each paper must register for ICDCS to be included in the
workshop program. </p>

<p>Accepted papers in the Workshop will be published in 
the IEEE CS Proceedings of ICDCS2004 Workshops.</p>
