<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

<h2 class="center">The Tenth International Workshop on Assurance in Distributed Systems and Networks (ADSN 2011)</h2>

<div class="paddingcenter">Hiroshima, Japan, March 26-27, 2011</div>

<div class="paddingcenter"><a href="http://adsn.net.info.hiroshima-cu.ac.jp/">http://adsn.net.info.hiroshima-cu.ac.jp/</a></div>

<!--<div class="paddingcenter">Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Distributed Processing<br/>
in cooperation with IEICE Technical Committee on Information Networks and IEICE Technical Committee on Dependable Computing (Pending)
</div>-->

<div class="paddingcenter">This workshop will be held in conjunction with the 10th International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ISADS 2011)</div>

<div class="paddingcenter">(<a href="http://www.isads2011.info.hiroshima-cu.ac.jp/" target="_top">http://www.isads2011.info.hiroshima-cu.ac.jp/</a>)</div>

<p>The objective of the Workshop is to provide an effective forum for original
scientific and engineering advances in Assurance in Distributed Systems and
Networks. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of ADSN, a special section on
Assurance for New Generation Network is being planned. Concerning this section,
a keynote address, a panel discussion, and a special session will be organized.</p>

<p>Along with rapid growth of the Internet cloud computing and ubiquitous networks,
autonomous decentralized systems are connected with each other. In these
distributed systems and networks, heterogeneous requirements are independently
generated and the requirements themselves are frequently changing. Assurance in
these distributed systems and networks is defined as capability of guaranteeing
functional and nonfunctional system properties such as dependability, security,
timeliness and adaptivity to heterogeneous and changing requirements.</p>

<p>The workshop theme is critical in meeting ever more demanding requirements for
assurance in systems and networks, especially in the future Internet and
ubiquitous networks. Technologies supporting assurance including integration of
various technologies such as real time, fault tolerance, autonomy, mobility and
intelligence will have to be incorporated in complex distributed systems and
networks.</p>

<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include, but are not limited to: <br>

<ul>
  <li>Assurance technologies for new generation network
  <li>Agents technologies for assurance
  <li>Assurance in cooperative embedded, grid and cloud computing systems
  <li>Heterogeneous systems coexistence and consistency techniques
  <li>Network control (QoS, QoE, CoS, etc) technologies for assurance
  <li>Real-time technology assurance
  <li>Security assurance
  <li>Self-stabilization and sensor networks assurance
  <li>Service-oriented and web service-based computing systems.
  <li>Software and hardware technologies (E-commerce, intelligent transport
  systems, train control, space computers) for assurance.
  <li>System life-cycle, specification, design, implementation, testing,
  verification, and validation techniques of assurance.
  <li>System management and proactive fault management techniques for assurance.
  <li>Techniques for achieving high assurance in complex systems.
</ul>
