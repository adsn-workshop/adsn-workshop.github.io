<h1>ADSN - International Workshop on Assurance in Distributed Systems and
Networks</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>The objective of the Workshop is to provide an effective forum for original scientific and engineering advances in Assurance in Distributed Systems and Networks. Along with recent rapid growth of the Internet and ubiquitous networks, autonomous decentralized systems are connected
with each other.  In these distributed systems and networks, heterogeneous requirements are independently generated and the requirements 
themselves are frequently changing.  Assurance in these distributed systems and
networks is defined as capability of guaranteeing functional and nonfunctional system properties such as dependability, security, 
timeliness and adaptivity to heterogeneous and changing requirements.  The workshop theme is critical in meeting 
ever more demanding requirements for assurance in systems and networks, especially in the future Internet and ubiquitous networks. Technologies supporting
assurance including integration of various technologies such as real time,
fault tolerance, autonomy, mobility and intelligence will have to be
incorporated in complex distributed systems and networks.</p>

is of interest in the sense that requirements for assurance in
distributed systems and networks are increasing in the future Internet
and technologies on assurance including integration of various
technologies on real time, fault tolerance, autonomy, mobility and
intelligence have high possibilities to cope with complex distributed
systems and networks.</p>

       Prospects on R&D for New-Generation Networks

       Masayuki Murata (Osaka University/NICT)

       The Internet is now becoming a societal infrastructure for supporting vital
       industrial and cultural activities. However, during its rapid development
       for meeting various requirements, ad hoc extensions, sometimes even
       inconsistent ones, have been repeatedly added to the Internet.  Accordingly,
       it is no exaggeration to say that it is like a patchwork from an
       architectural perspective.  The superiority of the fundamental design
       concept of the Internet has been frequently pointed out, but it is now being
       difficult to add more functions in order to meet various diverse
       requirements as the social infrastructure, and even to maintain expected
       functionalities of the complicated and large-scaled Internet.  Under such
       circumstances it is time to re-consider the design concept of the Internet,
       which can fundamentally solve the problems that we are facing with.  It is
       also required to meet the unknown new emerging technologies and future
       social demands.  Recently, research and development of those networks
       (called the future network or the future Internet) have been initiated in
       the world.  In Japan, NICT (The national Institute of Information and
       Communication Technologies) has been conducting such activities and calls it
       the new-generation network.
        In this talk, trends on R&D activities, including overseas, are first
       summarized.  Then, by introducing the activities of NICT for the
       new-generation network R&D, we look at what are targets of ICT-based future
       society and how we reach it by new-generation networks.  At first, NICT
       launched the AKARI project in 2006, which aims at building the basic design
       principle of the new-generation network architecture.  Here the architecture
       means a abstract set of design principles, harmonizing the user requirements
       and available technologies, and establishing the optimized and stable
       combinations.  After the new-generation network research and development
       headquarters was started in 2008, it announced a vision of future society
       achieved by the new-generation network. Also, it formulated a set of
       technology strategies which are necessary to build the new-generation
       network.  At the same time it developed innovation strategies for the
       ICT-centric future society, and international strategies to promote
       international cooperation with foreign countries.  Afterward, we launched a
       new-generation network research and development project in 2010, and begun
       the execution of the technology strategies by starting earnest several
       sub-projects.
        Through the introduction of these activities, the impacts of the
       new-generation network on future ICT infrastructure are discussed in this
       talk.
