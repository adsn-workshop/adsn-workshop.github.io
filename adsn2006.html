<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>The objective of the Workshop is to provide an effective forum for original scientific and engineering advances in Assurance in Distributed Systems and Networks. Along with recent rapid growth of the Internet and ubiquitous networks, autonomous decentralized systems are connected
with each other.  In these distributed systems and networks, heterogeneous requirements are independently generated and the requirements 
themselves are frequently changing.  Assurance in these distributed systems and
networks is defined as capability of guaranteeing functional and nonfunctional system properties such as dependability, security, 
timeliness and adaptivity to heterogeneous and changing requirements.  The workshop theme is critical in meeting 
ever more demanding requirements for assurance in systems and networks, especially in the future Internet and ubiquitous networks. Technologies supporting
assurance including integration of various technologies such as real time,
fault tolerance, autonomy, mobility and intelligence will have to be
incorporated in complex distributed systems and networks.</p>
